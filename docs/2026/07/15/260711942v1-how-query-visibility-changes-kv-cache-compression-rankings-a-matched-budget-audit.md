## TLDR
KV-cache compression method rankings invert under query-agnostic (reuse) protocols, with the performance drop per method directly proportional to how visible the question is in its scoring signal, and only query-independent methods like KeyDiff consistently beat trivial baselines.

## Abstract
KV-cache compression methods are predominantly evaluated with the query appended to the context before compression -- a query-aware protocol. Yet the economic case for a compressed KV cache is reuse: compress a document once, answer many future questions against it. In that deployment, compression must happen query-agnostic -- before any question is seen. We present a matched-budget audit of six published compression methods against three trivial baselines on three open 7-9B models (144,300 paired evaluations on RULER-8192; 40,800 on LongBench; 50,000-resample paired bootstrap throughout). Everything is held fixed -- model, compression ratio, instances, decoding -- except the scoring rule. Three findings. (1) Query visibility changes the rankings: under the agnostic protocol, of the five audited methods that share a common attention backend, only KeyDiff beats a best-of-3 trivial baseline consistently (31 of 36 cells), and the most widely deployed method, SnapKV, loses to "keep the start and the recent window" on average (-0.066). (2) The per-method drop between the two protocols is ordered consistently with how visible the question is to each method's scoring signal, legible in its source code: from Delta=+0.198 for SnapKV (the question sits inside its 64-token observation window) down to Delta=+0.011 for KeyDiff (its score contains no query term at all).
